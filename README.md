# hello-world
A hello world project for learning git

My name is Gary, I am a software engineering graduate and I like Java!(although I don't drink coffee)</br>
I'm looking for a job in the AI area, I'm learning Django and Tensorflow.

This is Komgcn, a collaborator on this project, I have added a line break at the end of line 4 after "coffee".

This is Gary, thanks for adding the break.
